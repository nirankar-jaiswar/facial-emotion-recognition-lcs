# Facial Emotion Recognition using Learning Classifier Systems (LCS)

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system using a **Learning Classifier System (LCS)** and compares its performance with conventional machine learning models such as **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **MLP**.  
The goal is to balance **accuracy** and **explainability**, highlighting how rule-based learning systems like LCS can provide interpretable models for emotion recognition.

## üß† Abstract

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in affective computing and human-computer interaction. This study employs a **Learning Classifier System (LCS)** to classify facial emotions from grayscale images using **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)** and **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** features.  
A combined dataset was created from two public sources‚Äî**FER-2013** and **Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset**‚Äîto enhance diversity and robustness.  
The proposed LCS achieved interpretable rule sets while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to traditional models.

## üß† Project Overview

### üîπ Objective
To develop a **Learning Classifier System (LCS)** model for recognizing facial emotions from images and compare its performance with traditional machine learning algorithms in terms of:
- Accuracy  
- F1-score  
- Precision & Recall  
- Interpretability (rule-based reasoning)

### üîπ Key Contributions
- Creation of a **combined custom dataset** using two publicly available datasets.
- Feature extraction using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** and **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**.
- Quantitative evaluation using a reproducible and explainable machine learning workflow.
- Demonstration of the interpretability advantages of LCS compared to conventional classifiers.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a **custom combination** of two publicly available facial emotion datasets:

1. [**Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohulaminlabid/facial-emotion-recognition-dataset) by *Rohul Amin Labid*  
2. [**FER-2013 Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/data) by *M. Sambare*

The two datasets were merged to increase diversity, reduce class imbalance, and improve the robustness of emotion classification.  

Each image is:
- Converted to **grayscale**
- Resized to **48√ó48 pixels**
- Transformed into **HOG + LBP feature vectors**
- Normalized using `StandardScaler`

**Dataset Split:**
| Split   |  Purpose          | Size    |    Description    |
|:------  |:---------         |:------: |:-------------     |
| `train/`| Model training    | 8.6 MB  | 80% of total data |
| `val/`  | Validation        | 1.9 MB  | 10% of total data |
| `test/` | Final evaluation  | 2.8 MB  | 10% of total data |

**Total size:** ‚âà 13.3 MB  
**Classes:** 7 (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise)

## üí° Critical Reflection

1. The **XCS model** successfully evolved interpretable rules for facial emotion recognition.  
2. **HOG + LBP** proved effective in preserving emotional texture and edge cues.  
3. Compared to SVM and MLP, **LCS** provides **better explainability** through IF‚ÄìTHEN rules, though training time was longer.  
4. The model struggled slightly with **subtle emotions** (e.g., Neutral vs. Sad).  
5. Further optimization is needed to enhance **generalization and population stability**.

---

## üî≠ Future Work

1. Explore hybrid approaches combining **XCS with deep learning (CNN-based embeddings)**.  
2. Integrate **genetic algorithm optimizations** (e.g., adaptive mutation or rule compression).  
3. Expand to larger datasets such as **FER+** and **AffectNet** for scalability testing.  
4. Conduct **human-in-the-loop evaluations** on interpretability and trust.
